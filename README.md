# Team-Profile-Generator
This project was designed to allow a user to follow command line prompts and generate a website with the name and contact information for their team members.  

## Motivation
My motivation for this project was to create an easy way for users to create a team page.  Trying to find all team members and their contact information can be a hassle, this project will allow the data to be stored one site that is easy to find.
